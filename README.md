Project XYZ git repo.

# Take a design, make it work:

What we will provide: 
- Asset files for a simple web design.  ( images and PSDs )
- A style guide ( important elements of the design that you need to follow will be defined there ).

Deliverables we expect for the final project:
- HTML
- CSS
- Images
- JavaScripts

We would like to see how he takes provided assets and turns them into a working html version of the site.  He can use whatever tools you feel comfortable with to complete the task.  Emphasis should be placed on code organization, creative problem solving, code quality and attention to detail.

I think we should give him one round of revisions on the project, to see how he handles feedback.  This is really to evaluate current skills and willingness to do something new if asked.  If this goes well we can then look at giving a task that would evaluate backend development a bit better.
