Project XYZ git repo.

# Take a design, make it work:

## What we will provide: 

- Asset files for a simple web design.  ( images and PSDs )
- A style guide ( important elements of the design that you need to follow will be defined there ).

## Deliverables we expect for the final project:

- HTML
- CSS
- Images
- JavaScripts

We would like to see how you take provided assets and turns them into a working html version of the site. You can use whatever tools you feel comfortable with to complete the task.  

## Emphasis should be placed:

- code organization
- creative problem solving
- code quality
- attention to detail.

You will get a round of revisions from Bryan as the project nears its end.  This is really to evaluate your current skills.
